# Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina - Member Document Library

## NC State - Team 9

## Overview

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) is a health insurance company that operates in the state of North Carolina in the United States. The company is headquartered in Durham, North Carolina and provides a wide range of health insurance coverage options to individuals, families, and businesses throughout the state.

The current API-based implementation of the Document Library for the Member Portal utilizes multiple API layers, which have caused an increase in software complexity, and consequently, slower performance and higher cost. Our team has been tasked with producing an embedded application that utilizes ElasticSearch (a document indexing solution) to reduce the amount of API layers. Reducing the amount of API layers will reduce BCBS’s overhead that is normally spent on code and database maintenance, as well as optimize overall customer experience by providing customers with a seamless user interface for accessing member documents.
